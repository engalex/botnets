This is code from the Botnets research project, built around 2010.  It is currently Python 2.6
based and is not being actively maintained.

The Botnets system is a python-based set of tools that can be used together or independently to help
detect botnet-infected hosts on a network. The system is geared toward medium to large networks, as
it relies on netflow data, and/or DNS query syslog data in order to effect detection. The code is
being developed and tested on Linux.

The README and INSTALL files describe the system in more detail and explain the steps necessary to
install it. Furthermore, each script/program includes extensive module-level, class-level, and
method-level documentation. Just fire up your favorite text editor (vim!) and let your eyeballs do
the walking. :-)

This software was initially developed by researchers at The University of Michigan and Merit
Network, Inc. It has since been released as an open source project and no official support is
available from these organizations. Please do not contact anyone at those organizations directly for
support. Instead, please post to this project forum when reading the documentation fails to answer
your questions.
